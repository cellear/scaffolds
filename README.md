scaffolds
=========

A responsive Drupal 7 theme to aid in development of Drupal site structure

This theme is not intended to be a production theme.  Instead, it's designed as a development tool, to help you put together an intial version of a Drupal site.  Start your site with Scaffold as your theme, and build the pieces -- views, panels, modules, content types, taxonomies -- all that stuff.  Get it functional, and then at the end choose or build your final theme to produce the finished product.

You can also switch to Scaffold to help figure out what is happening with a site.  If your site doesn't work without its custom theme, it means you've built business logic into your theme, and you should probably refactor.
